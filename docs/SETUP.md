# Setup and Installation Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the LinkPro Analytics system on Windows 10/11 with Python 3.13.7, pip 25.2, and PostgreSQL 17.6.

## Prerequisites

**System Requirements**
- Windows 10/11 operating system
- Administrator access for software installation
- Stable internet connection for downloading dependencies

**Required Software**
- Python 3.13.7 with pip 25.2
- PostgreSQL 17.6 database server
- Git version control system (recommended)

## Python Installation

Download Python 3.13.7 from python.org and run the installer with administrator privileges. During installation, select the "Add Python to PATH" checkbox to enable command-line access.

Verify the installation by opening Command Prompt and executing the version check commands.

```cmd
python --version
pip --version
```

The output should confirm Python 3.13.7 and pip 25.2 are correctly installed and accessible.

## PostgreSQL Database Setup

Download PostgreSQL 17.6 from the official PostgreSQL website and execute the installer. Configure the following settings during installation:

Set a secure password for the postgres superuser account. Use the default port 5432 for database connections. Enable pgAdmin for graphical database management. Add the PostgreSQL bin directory to the system PATH environment variable.

Test the installation by running the PostgreSQL version command in Command Prompt.

```cmd
psql --version
```

## Database Configuration

Connect to PostgreSQL using the psql command-line interface and create the analytics database.

```cmd
psql -U postgres
```

Execute the database creation commands within the PostgreSQL interface:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE linkpro_analytics;
CREATE USER linkpro_user WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD 'secure_password_here';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE linkpro_analytics TO linkpro_user;
\q
```

Replace 'secure_password_here' with a strong password that meets security requirements.

Initialize the database schema by executing the provided SQL setup script:

```cmd
psql -U postgres -d linkpro_analytics -f database_setup.sql
```

This command creates all necessary tables, indexes, and constraints required for the analytics system.

## Project Environment Setup

Create a Python virtual environment to isolate project dependencies from system packages.

```cmd
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

The command prompt should display the virtual environment name to confirm activation.

Install the required Python packages using the project requirements file:

```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This process installs FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL drivers, and all other necessary dependencies.

## Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory containing database connection parameters and application settings:

```env
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=linkpro_analytics
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASS=your_database_password
SECRET_KEY=your_secure_random_key
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_PORT=8000
CLICK_BATCH_SIZE=1000
ANALYTICS_CACHE_TTL=300
```

Replace the placeholder values with your actual database password and generate a secure random string for the SECRET_KEY parameter.

## System Validation

Test database connectivity using the provided verification script:

```cmd
python src\tests\test_db.py
```

This script validates PostgreSQL server connectivity, database access permissions, and basic query functionality.

Execute the comprehensive system test to verify all components:

```cmd
python backend\tests\test_analytics.py
```

The test suite generates sample data and validates tracking accuracy, analytics calculations, and API endpoint functionality.

## Server Deployment

Start the FastAPI development server with hot reload capabilities:

```cmd
uvicorn src.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

The server launches with automatic code reload enabled for development workflows.

Verify successful deployment by accessing these endpoints in your web browser:
- System health: http://localhost:8000/health
- API documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- System information: http://localhost:8000/api/system/info

## Dashboard Interface Setup

The analytics system includes a web-based dashboard providing real-time data visualization and performance monitoring capabilities.

Place the dashboard files (index.html, dashboard.css, dashboard.js) in a dedicated frontend directory within your project structure.

Configure the API connection in dashboard.js by updating the base URL variable:

```javascript
const API_BASE_URL = 'http://localhost:8000';
```

Serve the dashboard using Python's built-in HTTP server. Navigate to the frontend directory and execute:

```cmd
python -m http.server 8080
```

Access the dashboard interface at http://localhost:8080 to view analytics data and interactive visualizations.

## Machine Learning Environment

Install Jupyter notebooks and essential data science libraries for developing the recommendation system:

```cmd
pip install jupyter pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

Create a notebooks directory within your project structure to organize machine learning workflows and model development procedures.

Launch the Jupyter notebook server to begin data analysis and model development:

```cmd
jupyter notebook
```

The Jupyter interface opens in your web browser, providing an interactive environment for exploratory data analysis and predictive modeling.

## Data Science Pipeline

Connect to the PostgreSQL database within Jupyter notebooks using the same connection parameters established for the backend API. Implement data extraction procedures to retrieve analytics data for pattern analysis and model training.

The machine learning pipeline processes historical click events, page views, and user engagement metrics to identify trends and performance indicators. Statistical analysis examines temporal patterns while content performance models analyze link characteristics and positioning strategies.

Traffic source optimization models examine referrer patterns and conversion funnels to recommend platform-specific engagement strategies across different social media channels.

## Testing and Validation

The system includes comprehensive testing utilities to verify installation success and validate functionality. Database connectivity tests ensure proper PostgreSQL configuration while API endpoint tests validate response accuracy and performance.

Generate synthetic test data using the provided utilities to validate system behavior under various load conditions. The testing framework provides detailed reports on tracking accuracy, analytics calculations, and system performance metrics.

Execute regular testing during development to ensure code changes do not introduce regressions or performance degradation.

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

**Database Connection Problems**
Verify PostgreSQL service status through Windows Services management. Check firewall settings to ensure port 5432 allows connections. Confirm database credentials in the environment configuration match those set during PostgreSQL installation.

**Python Environment Issues**
Ensure Python is properly installed and accessible from the command line. Recreate the virtual environment if activation fails. Clear pip cache if persistent installation errors occur during dependency installation.

**Server Startup Failures**
Check for port conflicts if the server fails to start on port 8000. Use netstat commands to identify processes using the target port. Verify all requirements are installed in the active virtual environment.

**Dashboard Loading Issues**
Confirm the backend API server is running before accessing the dashboard. Check browser console for JavaScript errors and verify the API_BASE_URL configuration matches your server deployment.

## Performance Optimization

Database performance benefits from proper indexing strategies and connection pool configuration. Monitor query execution times through PostgreSQL logging and optimize frequently accessed data patterns.

Application performance improves through caching strategies for analytics calculations and efficient query design patterns. Consider implementing Redis for session caching in high-traffic scenarios.

## Security Considerations

Production deployments require comprehensive security measures including API authentication, rate limiting, and input validation. Implement proper CORS policies that restrict cross-origin access to authorized domains.

Ensure sensitive configuration parameters are stored securely and not committed to version control systems. Use environment-specific configuration management for deployment flexibility.

This installation guide provides the complete foundation for deploying a professional analytics platform with advanced machine learning capabilities suitable for enterprise applications and data-driven optimization strategies.
